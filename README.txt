Code is written in Engine.java and GUIFrame.java
The main method is in GUIFrame.java, so use that file to run the program. 
There is a library of words in the Dictionary.txt file and I recommend that you use it, but it should not be necessary to run the program.
I don't know if you need the .classpath or .project files, so I included them just in case.
